# trustedfor-design

**Background:**
TrustedFor is a startup from YCombinator’s Spring 2019 cohort that is making “Linkedin 2.0”: an invite-only platform for professional profiles that is centered around recommendations from people that the users have worked alongside. As active Linkedin users, we have often felt annoyed by getting spam requests from random profiles and believe that TrustedFor has the potential to make online professional networking feel more trustworthy and personal.

We imagined what the platform might look like on a mobile device, and used iterative design and user testing to come up with sketches and a working prototype.
